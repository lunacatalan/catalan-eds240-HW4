## Part 2b

1. I have learned that the construction type of affordable housing built in LA since 2003 with the most number of total units has been Rehabs. This is interesting given that the type of housing that has the most units is Family. I don't know if there is some overlap here, or what the qualifications for going into rehab. Another interesting pattern is that the number of total projects each year has gine up and down, with two kind of peaks in 2006 and 2021, but for the most part remained steady. However, the amount of funding from the LA housing development has increased what looks like exponentially since 2003. This is interesting seeing as there are not a large increase in projects. I am wondering where the funding was coming from before, or if there is another variable driving cost. 

2. I have gained some insight into the questions regarding the way affordable housing has changed over the last 20 years, and including the spatial distribution and quantity of units. Given the change in funding, I think I am closer to answering how LA is adhering to the 2015 execuutive directive 13. I think I want to look more into the directive, and really understand the elements that were required. I also want to posible find some data on funding for affordable housing, or maybe funding for other areas. I drew up some preliminary spatial maps of were AH is being developed and there is a concentration in 2 county subdivisions. I want to see if there are proposed projects somewhere, and where those are compared to where the projects that got accepted are. I would also like to see the impact of what those developments have had, and if there is data on what happens to the people that get affordable housing. I am curious to see the way that affordable housing could be used a means for social mobility. 

3. I already encountered some challenges when it came to matching neighborhoods, so I think that in the future I will probably encounter the same issues but now I know how to tackle those. Also, I feel like the AH data is at a finer spatial resolution in terms of neighborhood than other types of census data. This is challenging because seeing specific patterns might be hard. Also, I want to parse out the types of construction/housing type to have a more specific data set instead of having categories that are joined. In terms of looking at individuals data, I am doubtful that there will be a dataset following pre/post affordable housing so I will see if that is a good question.
